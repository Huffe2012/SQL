# SQL

ðŸ“Š SQL Learning Project
I enrolled in a SQL bootcamp through Udemy to learn and test my SQL knowledge.



ðŸ›  Tools & Setup
PostgreSQL was installed locally to run queries and practice hands-on.



ðŸŽ¬ Sample Data
The course provided a .tar file containing sample data for a DVD rental business.

You can find the file here: dvdrental (1).tar
(Note: Rename the file to dvdrental.tar for easier use in pgAdmin or the command line.)

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Install PostgreSQL.

Open pgAdmin or your terminal and restore the database from the .tar file:

pgAdmin â†’ Create a new database â†’ Right-click â†’ Restore â†’ Select the tar file.

Or use CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
pg_restore -U your_username -d your_database dvdrental.tar
